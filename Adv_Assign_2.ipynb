    "The relationship between classes and modules is that classes can be defined within modules. A module is a file containing Python code, and it can have one or more classes defined within it. Classes provide a way to define objects with specific attributes and behaviors, while modules serve as containers for organizing and grouping related classes, functions, and variables. Modules can be imported and used in other modules or scripts, allowing the classes defined within them to be accessed and utilized.\n"
