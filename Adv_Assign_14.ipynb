    "The += assignment operator is not just for show; it can indeed lead to faster results at runtime in certain scenarios. The += operator performs an in-place addition, which means it modifies the value of the variable directly instead of creating a new object. This can be more efficient in terms of memory and performance, especially when working with mutable objects like lists. In contrast, using the + operator to concatenate objects creates a new object, which can be less efficient if the objects involved are large."
