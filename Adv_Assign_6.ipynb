    "\n",
    "Error handling: Exceptions are commonly used to handle and manage errors that occur during the execution of a program. By using try-except blocks, you can catch and handle specific exceptions, allowing your program to gracefully recover from errors and continue executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input validation: Exceptions can be used to validate user input or data input from external sources. If the input doesn't meet certain criteria or is in an invalid format, you can raise an exception and handle it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Exceptions are useful for managing resources such as file handling, database connections, or network connections. By using try-finally or try-except-finally blocks, you can ensure that resources are properly released and cleaned up, even if an exception occurs."

    "Raising a different exception: Within an except block, you can raise a different exception to indicate a higher-level error or to provide more specific information about the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging and reporting: You can log the exception details and report them to a logging system or to the user. This can help in debugging and identifying issues in the code.\n",
    "\n",

For example, calling open() on a non-existent file raises a FileNotFoundError, or dividing a number by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError."

    "Using the finally block: The finally block is used in conjunction with a try-except block and allows you to specify code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or is caught. This is useful for performing necessary cleanup or releasing resources, ensuring that certain actions are taken regardless of the program's execution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the atexit module: The atexit module provides a way to register functions that will be called when the program exits, whether through normal execution or due to an unhandled exception. By using the atexit.register() function, you can specify one or more functions to be executed at program termination, allowing you to perform cleanup tasks or final actions before the program exits."
