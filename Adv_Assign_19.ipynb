By prefixing an instance or class variable with double underscores (e.g., __variable), Python performs name mangling, which changes the variable name to _ClassName__variable. This makes the variable \"private\" in the sense that it becomes harder to access directly from outside the class. However, it is still possible to access and modify these variables if desired, so Python's encapsulation is not as strict as in some other languages."

Calling super().__init__() ensures that the parent class's __init__ method is executed before any additional customization specific to the subclass."
