    "Text files and binary files differ in how they store and represent data. Text files are human-readable and contain characters encoded using a specific character encoding (e.g., UTF-8). They typically store plain text and can include newline characters to separate lines. Binary files, on the other hand, store data in binary format, representing it as a sequence of bytes. They can store any type of data, including text, numbers, images, or program instructions. Binary files do not rely on a specific character encoding and can represent data more efficiently, but they are not directly human-readable."

They can preserve the exact binary representation of the data and are more suitable for high-performance or specialized data storage needs."

These include differences in endianness (the order of bytes), platform-specific integer sizes, and compatibility between systems.
