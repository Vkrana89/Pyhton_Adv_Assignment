    "The main distinction between a NumPy array and a pandas DataFrame is that a NumPy array is a homogeneous multidimensional array, while a pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with potentially heterogeneous columns. Here are some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same data type, indexed by integers. In contrast, a pandas DataFrame is a tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns, allowing for different data types in each column.\n",
    "Flexibility: While a NumPy array provides efficient numerical operations and mathematical functions, a pandas DataFrame offers additional functionality like indexing, slicing, and merging datasets. It also supports handling missing data, time series data, and descriptive statistics.\n",
    "Indexing: NumPy arrays use positional indexing, while pandas DataFrames allow both positional and label-based indexing, providing more flexibility in accessing and manipulating data.\n",
    "Additional Functionality: pandas DataFrames provide built-in support for handling time series data, data alignment, handling missing values, and powerful data manipulation operations like pivoting, melting, grouping, and aggregation.\n",
    "You can convert a NumPy array to a pandas DataFrame using the pandas.DataFrame() constructor by passing the NumPy array as the data argument. Similarly, you can convert a pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array using the DataFrame.values attribute."

    "Case sensitivity: Stock symbols are often case-sensitive, so the user's input might need to be properly formatted or validated.\n",
