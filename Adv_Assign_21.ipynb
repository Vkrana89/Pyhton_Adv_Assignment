    "In Python, a probability distribution can be represented using various statistical libraries such as NumPy or SciPy. These libraries provide functions to define and work with different probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, binomial distribution, or exponential distribution. While the individual values from a probability distribution may appear random, the distribution itself follows a defined mathematical function. By using the properties of the distribution, we can make predictions about the likelihood of different outcomes or events occurring."

    "In Python, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers. The random module in Python provides functions to generate pseudo-random numbers using algorithms. These algorithms produce a sequence of numbers that appear random but are deterministic, meaning that given the same seed value, the sequence will be the same. Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for most purposes because they exhibit statistical properties of randomness, such as uniform distribution and independence between numbers. However, if true randomness is required, Python also provides the secrets module, which uses a cryptographic source to generate secure random numbers."

    "The behavior of a \"normal\" probability distribution in Python is influenced by two main factors: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center or average value of the distribution and can be set using the loc parameter in probability distribution functions. The standard deviation controls the spread or dispersion of values around the mean and can be set using the scale parameter. By adjusting the mean and standard deviation, you can create normal distributions with different characteristics."

IQ scores are often assumed to follow a normal distribution, where the majority of people have scores around the mean (usually set at 100), and fewer people have scores that deviate significantly from the mean. By using Python's statistical libraries, you can analyze and model the IQ score distribution, calculate probabilities for different ranges of scores, or generate random IQ scores following a normal distribution."

However, as the number of trials or samples increases, the distribution tends to converge to its expected behavior. This is known as the law of large numbers, which states that the average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends to approach the expected value. As the number of trials grows, the distribution becomes more stable and follows the expected probabilities and patterns defined by the distribution function.\n"
