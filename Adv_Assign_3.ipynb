    "The concept of an abstract superclass refers to a class that is designed to be inherited from but not instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for its subclasses, providing common attributes, methods, and behavior that can be inherited and overridden. An abstract superclass often contains abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented in the superclass itself. Subclasses are responsible for implementing these abstract methods according to their specific requirements. Abstract superclasses provide a way to define common interfaces and behaviors for related classes while enforcing consistency and modularity in code design."

This means that the assigned value becomes an attribute of the class itself, shared by all instances of the class. This attribute can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class. It is similar to a static variable in other programming languages."

By calling the superclass's __init__ method, the subclass can leverage the initialization logic defined in the superclass, ensuring that the inherited attributes are properly initialized. This is typically done using the super() function within the subclass's __init__ method."
