The goal of doing this can be to have multiple references to the module, which can be useful in certain situations. One such situation is when different parts of the codebase need to access the module using different names or aliases. It can also be helpful when using a module that provides different sub-modules or functionalities, and you want to import and use them separately.\n",

    "Move import statements: Move import statements inside functions or methods, so they are executed only when needed, rather than at the module level.\n",
