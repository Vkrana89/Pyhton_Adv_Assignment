OOP allows you to define classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. It emphasizes the concept of objects that encapsulate data and behavior, enabling you to model real-world entities or abstract concepts in your code."

The search starts with the current class, then proceeds to its parent classes in a depth-first, left-to-right order. This means that the attribute is first searched in the current class, then in its immediate parent class, and so on, until it is found or all the parent classes have been searched."

This argument refers to the instance object that the method is being called on. By convention, it is called self to indicate that it represents the instance itself. When you call a method on an instance object, Python automatically passes the instance object as the first argument (i.e., self) to the method. This allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and perform operations specific to that instance."

It is where you typically define and assign initial values to the instance variables that define the state of the object. By defining the __init__ method, you can ensure that certain code is executed whenever a new instance of the class is created."
